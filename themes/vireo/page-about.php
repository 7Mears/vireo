              <h3>Web design and content creation</h3>
              <p>At Vireo, we believe in beautifying the Internet, and that top-notch writing, images, and videos are just as important to a website’s success as the design itself. We believe partnering with clients is the best way to serve your needs, and that the best partnerships are open and transparent. Named for the vireo, a type of bird that summers in Saskatchewan, we’re proud of our prairie roots.</p>
