<p class="process-intro">At Vireo Productions, we’re building your business its own unique site, and to do that, we need your help. Our goal is to take your ideas and bring them to life, but we can’t do that without you!

See below a typical timeline for our process. From beginning to end, the whole process takes about three months to complete. Keep in mind this timeline may vary depending on the project.</p>


            <ul class="timeline">
            					<li>
            						<span class="phase">Phase 1</span>

            						<div class="tmlabel">
            							<h3>The first meeting</h3>
            							<p>Asking how much it costs to build a website is like asking how much it costs to build a house. Before we can give you a price, we need to know what we’re building. During our first meeting, we’ll find out what you need. This is where you give us the broad brush strokes of the project you have in mind.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: Bring your biggest ideas to the table!</span></p>

            						<div class="tmlabel">
            							<h3>The estimate</h3>
            							<p>After our first meeting, we will break down your ideas into a solid list of components with pricing. The list is a starting point; everything is up for discussion. Once we’ve settled the details, we’ll send you a contract. Upon acceptance of the contract, we’ll send an invoice for half the cost of the project, to be paid in advance.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: Review and discuss our estimate and contract, and send the invoice so we can get to work. Most of this step will be done via email or over the phone.</span></p>

            							<h3>Content and design meeting</h3>
            							<p>The most beautiful website ever created would look pretty bad without any words or images. At this meeting, we’ll talk about the message you want to share, the images you want to project, how the website will fit with your brand, and everything else related to design and content. We’ll also get the technical details lined up, like buying a domain name.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: Come prepared with ideas and information about your brand. Send us any promotional materials you already have, including your logo.</span></p>

            							<h3>Content approval</h3>
            							<p>At Vireo Productions, we work with a content first approach: Before we start designing the website, we like to have all of the content in place. We’ll be in touch via emails and phone calls as we refine the content that will appear on the site, asking for your approval along the way.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: Ensure someone with your business is available to approve the content we create, and send us any content you might be providing.</span></p>

            							<h3>Mock-ups meeting</h3>
            							<p>This meeting will be the first time you get to see the static designs we’ve come up with. We’ll be focusing on early feedback, ensuring we’re headed in the right direction. Major changes may happen at this point, which is a normal part of the creative process. We’ll make any necessary revisions.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: Keep an open mind, and recognize this isn’t the final look of the website. Let us know if there are any changes you’d like to see.</span></p>

            							<h3>Working prototype meeting</h3>
            							<p>At this point, we’ve built a working version of the site on our own servers so you can get a feel for how it will appear when it’s live. Animations you couldn’t experience on the mock-ups will come to life. Content will be in place. We’ll be in the process of doing usability testing on different browsers.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: We’re nearly ready to launch at this point, so now is the time to let us know your final thoughts about the working site.</span></p>

            							<h3>How-to guide</h3>
            							<p>We build our websites using WordPress because it’s easy to use, even if you’ve never updated a website before. Even so, we want to make sure you can run the site yourself, so all of our clients get a personalized guide showing how to update the site. Along with the guide, you’ll get the passwords and log-in information.
                            <span class="your-job">Your job: We’ll send this info via email, so make sure to save it in a safe place.</span></p>

                          <p>A week or so after the launch of the site, we’ll meet with you to discuss the project and answer any questions you may have. We’ll also start talking about the future. Your business is constantly changing, and your website should change with you. What’s the next step for your business, and your website?

                          <p>Many of our clients choose to run their own website, but if you prefer, we can run it for you for a monthly fee. If you’re running it yourself and something goes wrong, let us know; if we can fix it in under 15 minutes, we won’t charge you for our time. And we’re always happy to answer questions about your website any time.
